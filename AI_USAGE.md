# AI Usage Disclosure

AI-assisted tools (including ChatGPT) were used during the development of this project for:

- Generating initial PyTorch boilerplate code
- Structuring documentation and explanations
- Debugging implementation and compatibility issues

## Verification

All AI-generated code and text were manually reviewed, tested, and verified by the author.
Physical constraints (Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and unit trace) were explicitly validated
in the final implementation.
